My first game ever is here!

My dear son Daniel is one of my inspirations for this game. Based on the classic Brickout, this game was created using Java following [this](http://zetcode.com/tutorials/javagamestutorial/breakout/) tutorial by Jan Bodnar.
This was done for onegameamonth.com as a first submission. Due to game jam time constraints, I couldn’t improve anything, but I hope you like it.

Any comments or suggestions are welcome.
