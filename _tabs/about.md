Initially I had a WordPress blog started in 2013 when I started my exploration around games programming. Back then I had no ideas of where to start, but shortly after I found the “One Game a Month” online game jam, I decided to joined the challenge for 1 year. 

Even though those activities are quite different, I feel quite happy both playing and coding games. My blogging also included other topics besides game dev, so you can expect once in a while something lighter, less technical and more personal.

Fast forwarding some years, this is 2023 and after many life-changing events, I've decided to move my old blog posts into this Jekyll website and continue blogging.

Finally I want to mention that any views expressed or thoughts are my own, eventually inspired by other good human beings who shared their knowledge, but ultimately all I want to say last is that all this doesn’t represent anyone or anything I’m associated with.
